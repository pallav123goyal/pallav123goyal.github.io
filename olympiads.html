  During high school, I loved participating in math olympiads and other competitions. I participated in the <a href= "https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2013">54th International Mathematical Olympiad </a> at Santa Marta, Columbia and won a bronze medal.
<br>
  Before that, I qualified the Regional Mathematics Olympiad (RMO) in 2010 and the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO) in 2011 and 2012, and was selected for attending the IMO Training Camp (IMOTC) at HBCSE, Mumbai from 2011 to 2013.

  I still quite enjoy solving problems from the IMO and Putnam whenever I take time off research and I am always happy to discuss problems that I have solved and provide advice to high-school students for training for olympiads. I have given lectures at <a href="http://www.kcseducate.in/">KCS</a> on high school olympiads. Some problem sheets based on my lectures:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Pigeonhole Principle - <a href="PHP.pdf">pdf</a>		
			<li> Recurrence Relations - <a href="recurrence.pdf">pdf</a>
			<li> Ceva's Theorem - <a href="ceva.pdf">pdf</a>
			<li> Inequalities - <a href="inequalities.pdf">pdf</a>
		</ul>
Personally, I find geometry to be the most challenging subject in olympiads, and so, a fun hobby of mine is to bash IMO geometry problems (whenever I can) using coordinate geometry, complex numbers or trigonometry. A compilation of some of my attempts can be found here - <a href="olympiad_geometry.pdf">pdf</a>
